# KairosUI - generate beautiful UIs efforessly

## 🚀 Introduction
**KairosUI** is a platform that enables you to generate fully-functional small apps with just one prompt. By harnessing the power of Meta's Llama 3.1 & Together.ai to streamline your development process like never before. This project is perfect for developers, hobbyists, and anyone looking to automate code generation.

## 🚀 BackStory
**KairosUI** is a spin-off/inspired from an old project of mine **Kairos** [Kairos Repo](https://github.com/sarthakkapila/kairos) [Kairos Live link](https://kairos-ai.streamlit.app) which is a project I made when DevinAI was launched.
Kairos was a full fledged AI developer which was made using various AI agents that would identify the prompt, devise a plan, research on it and then scrape the internet to generate code and even the dependencies!
